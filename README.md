# Imprisoned

- Project by Krunal, Richard and Andy

##### Synopsis: Prisoners have been imprisoned for life and many of them were falsely accused of crimes they didnâ€™t commit. As many of them wish for a second chance at life, they are granted this wish, however, they need to put in some work towards it. The prisoners find out that they can switch spots with the prison guards for an hour a day. During this hour, they can monitor the routes that the guards patrol, hide keys in specific areas, set up traps, destroy records, etc. Once the hour is up, the positions are reverted and prisoners will have a chance to achieve their goals with the knowledge that they have gained. The prison guards will have no memory of what happened. Will you control their fate?
